//MARK: Project 5, Part 1

//It's time for another new project, and this is actualy the last easy project we have of this course - after this the difficulty level ramps up a little as we tackle bigger apps, so enjoy this while it lasts!

//In this app you'll work with two of the real fundamentals of app development: List for working with tables of data, and strings, for handling text. Yes, we covered strings wuite a bit alread, but now we're really going to dig into them, including how to work with their Unicode representation so we can get compatibility with older Objective-C frameworks.

//Unicode is a standard for storing and representing text, which at first glance you might think sounds esy. But trust me on this: it really isn't. You know how I seaid sates are hard? Well, dates are easy compared to storing text properly. In fact, there's even a joke mug you can buy that says "I ? Unicode" - a painful reminder that when text representation goes bad all you see is a question mark where the symbol should be.

//Today you have four topics to work through and you'll meet List, Bundle, UITextChecker, and more.

// 1. Word Scramble: Introduction

// 2. Introducing List, Your Best Friend

// 3. Loading Resources From Your App Bundle

// 4. Working with Strings
