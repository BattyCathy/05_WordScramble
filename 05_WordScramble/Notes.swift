//MARK: Project 5, Part 1

//It's time for another new project, and this is actualy the last easy project we have of this course - after this the difficulty level ramps up a little as we tackle bigger apps, so enjoy this while it lasts!

//In this app you'll work with two of the real fundamentals of app development: List for working with tables of data, and strings, for handling text. Yes, we covered strings wuite a bit alread, but now we're really going to dig into them, including how to work with their Unicode representation so we can get compatibility with older Objective-C frameworks.

//Unicode is a standard for storing and representing text, which at first glance you might think sounds esy. But trust me on this: it really isn't. You know how I seaid sates are hard? Well, dates are easy compared to storing text properly. In fact, there's even a joke mug you can buy that says "I ? Unicode" - a painful reminder that when text representation goes bad all you see is a question mark where the symbol should be.

//Today you have four topics to work through and you'll meet List, Bundle, UITextChecker, and more.

// 1. Word Scramble: Introduction

//This project will be another game, although really it's just a sneaky way for me to introduce more Swift and SWiftUI knowledge! The game will show players a random eight-letter work, and askk them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is "alarming" they might spell "alarm", "ring", "main", and so on.

//Along the way you'll meet List, onAppear(), Bundle, fatalError(), adn more - all useful skills that you'll use for years to come. You'll also get some practice with @State, Alert, NavigationView, and more, which you should enjoy while you can - this is our last easy project!

//To get started, please create a new Single View App project called WordScramble. You'll need to downlod the files for this project, as it contains a file called start.txt that you'll be needing later on.

//Okay, oet's get into some code.


// 2. Introducing List, Your Best Friend

// 3. Loading Resources From Your App Bundle

// 4. Working with Strings
